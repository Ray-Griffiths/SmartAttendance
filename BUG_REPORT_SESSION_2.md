# Session 2 Status

## Summary
Performed thorough codebase review searching for critical bugs:
- Checked `admin_routes.py`, `lecturer_routes.py`, and `student_routes.py`
- Initially identified 2 suspected Flask response tuple bugs in admin_routes
- Upon verification, found that both issues have already been fixed in the current codebase

## Investigation Results
✅ No critical bugs found in current code
✅ All Flask response tuples are properly formatted (2-element tuples)
✅ Code follows correct patterns throughout

The codebase appears to be in good working condition with no immediate critical issues.
